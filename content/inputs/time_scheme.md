| `CFL`                | `real`        | `0.1`         | \\    | Analogous to the CFL condition, this is used to scale the time step size to get a maximum stable time step. The maximum value this can be while also keeping a simulation stable is very dependent on the simulation/flow-conditions and input settings, and experimentation is generally required to find a good value. A lower value is more likely to keep a simulation stable, but it will require more time steps to reach either convergence or a given simulation time. Typical values are $0.1 \leq CFL \leq 2$, but past experience has found simulations that were stable with values up to 7. |
